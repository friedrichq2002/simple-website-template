            <h2>Explanations for my GPA</h2>
            <p>
              I suffered my first academic failure in my first winter study. Coming from a low-income
              family, I had been bearing huge pressure related to living from my family because my parents
              were still paying back the loans for paying my education in high school. Sometimes I felt
              nervous and unsupported when I was alone on campus. I faced difficulty assimilating to this
              new environment and found myself physically sick and mentally exhausted. The Deans of
              Williams shared their love, care, support, and with it, I found the motivation and confidence
              to move forward. Through a period of adjustment, my body, my mind, and my academic
              performance gradually got back on track. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After sophomore year I decided to take a gap year to study abroad at the Budapest Semesters
              in Mathematics program (BSM) to explore the depth and breadth of the field of mathematics.
              However, my studies at BSM did not go smoothly as I expected. On one hand, I enrolled in 6
              advanced math courses during the first semester, including graduate courses, and I cannot
              deal with the unexpected heavy workload. On the other hand, the impact of the pandemic and the
              Russia-Ukraine war made it difficult for me to fully immerse myself in my studies, resulting
              in decline in grades. Nevertheless, I did not give up. Instead, I actively communicated with
              professors and addressed my issues, and adjusted the number of my courses. Through my
              unwavering efforts and persistence, my GPA rose to 3.78/4.0 in the second semester. So far I
              have completed 40+ advanced courses in math and computer science. I have been on the
              Dean’s List from fall 2020 to present, and my major GPA will rise to 3.8/4.0 by fall 2023.
              Currently I am working on my honors thesis in computer science with Prof. Aaron Williams.
              It has been my long-cherished expectation to enter your prestigious university for a Ph.D.
              program that will make possible my even more fruitful career development in the future. I
              believe that my challenging undergraduate experience reinforced my already deep interest in
              mathematics and computer science, and prepared me for a lifelong career in this field.
